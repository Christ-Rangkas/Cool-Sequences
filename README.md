# Cool-Sequences
The user input consists of a sequence of numbers from the set {1,2,3} followed by the number âˆ’1 that signifies the end of the input. 
Make the program that repeatedly performs the following operation on the entire sequence until the sequence gets transformed into one that has all terms equal:  
In each step, starting from the left we identify the first two terms of the sequence that are different from each other. Then we remove these two terms and replace them by one single term that is equal to neither of the two original terms. For example (12) is replaced by 3; (21) is replaced by 3; (32) is replaced by 1.
